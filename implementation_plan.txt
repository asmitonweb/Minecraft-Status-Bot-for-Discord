# System Tray Support Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
The goal is to allow the Minecraft Status Monitor to run in the background with a system tray icon. This will declutter the user's taskbar while keeping the monitor active. The user will be able to control the application (quit) via the tray icon.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This change requires installing new Python packages: `pystray` and `Pillow`.

## Proposed Changes

### Dependencies
- Install `pystray` and `Pillow`.

### Code Changes

#### [MODIFY] [minecraft_status_monitor.py](file:///c:/Programs/Discord%20App%20to%20Update%20server%20Status/minecraft_status_monitor.py)
- Import `pystray` and `PIL` (Pillow).
- Implement a function to create a simple icon programmatically (e.g., a colored circle).
- Refactor `main()` to run the monitoring loop in a separate `threading.Thread`.
- Implement a `setup_tray()` function to create the icon and "Quit" menu item.
- Update the entry point to start the tray application.

#### [MODIFY] [run_monitor.bat](file:///c:/Programs/Discord%20App%20to%20Update%20server%20Status/run_monitor.bat)
- Change `python` to `pythonw` to prevent the console window from appearing at all.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Run `run_monitor.bat`.
2. Verify that no console window remains open (or it closes immediately).
3. Check the system tray (bottom right) for a new icon.
4. Hover over the icon to see the tooltip (optional).
5. Right-click the icon and select "Quit".
6. Verify the process terminates.
